# Shell

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive shell interface that enhances process control, user interaction, and error handling mechanisms.

### Part 1: Prompt
- **Responsibilities**: Prompt the user with their directory path by expanding their $USER, $MACHINE, $PWD environment variables.

### Part 2: Environment Variables
- **Responsibilities**: Replace tokens prefixed with the dollar sign character ($) with their corresponding values.

### Part 3: Tilde Expansion
- **Responsibilities**: In Bash, tilde (~) may appear at the beginning of a path, and it expands to the environment variable $HOME.

### Part 4: $PATH Search
- **Responsibilities**: When a command like "ls" is entered, the shell is able to execute the corresponding program/executable located at "/usr/bin/ls".

### Part 5: External Command Execution
- **Responsibilities**: Now that we have the $PATH Search, we must fork() to create a child process. The child process will be responsible for executing the desired command using the execv() function.

### Part 6: I/O Redirection
- **Responsibilities**: By default, the shell receives input from the keyboard and outputs to the screen. However, with I/O redirection, we can replace the keyboard with input from a specified file and redirect output to a designated file.

### Part 7: Piping
- **Responsibilities**: Contrary to regular I/O redirection, piping involves the simultaneous execution of multiple commands, with the input and output of these commands interconnected. This setup allows the output generated by the initial command to be seamlessly passed as input to the subsequent command.

### Part 8: Background Processing
- **Responsibilities**: Thus far, the shell has been waiting to prompt for additional user input whenever there were external commands running. Background processing allows the shell to execute external commands without waiting for their completion. However, it is still essential for the shell to keep track of their completion status periodically.

### Part 9: Internal Command Execution
- **Responsibilities**: Having completed external command execution, the next aspect to address is the implementation of internal commands, often referred to as built-in functions.

## How to Compile & Execute

### Requirements
- **Compiler**: `gcc` for C/C++

### Compilation
For a C/C++ example:
```bash
make
```
This will build the executable in shell/bin
### Execution
```bash
make run
```
This will run the program in shell/bin
